    <h2>ek tha raja ek thi rani</h2>
    <p>Life constantly throws new challenges our way,
         each one shaping who we are. I find that growth often comes not from comfort but from discomfort,
          pushing me to adapt and evolve. Embracing these moments, instead of resisting them, helps me build resilience.
           Every struggle becomes a stepping stone toward a stronger self</p>
